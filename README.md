## Challenges I ran into 💻
- Fixing Dynamic Pages within another page and maintaining right databases.
- Authentication (Login/Logout).
- Understanding the functionality of the items inside the pages.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of 🏆
This is the **First Time** I'm using [Wix](https://www.wix.com/velo) and I am very surprised with the features. Specially Integrating an E-commerce was a wonderful learning experience to me.

## Few specific things I learnt using Velo by Wix 📚
1. Pages - Main & Dynamic
2. Add Interactions to Pages
3. Integrating Store
4. User Authentication (Login/Logout)
5. Using Databases
6. Integrate Payment Methods
7. Add Apps for additional functionality and more.
